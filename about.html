        <h1 class="heading-secondary">My (not so) quick story</h1>
        <p>
          I have always been passionate about learning & organization – I can
          still tell you what color-coordinated folders I’d attach to which
          subject (science = green, math = red). I majored in Psychology in
          college but found myself drawn to the technical side of the social
          sciences. While working in a research lab, I both administered
          assessments and worked with the assessment data, and I soon realized
          that I much preferred contributing to the lab's mission from
          behind-the-scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then worked as an operations specialist, where I validated skills
          assessments, built trackers, and automated manual processes through
          formulas and SQL queries. My projects & responsibilities ranged in
          scope from manual QA to research coordinator to project manager &
          developer. I loved learning something new with each task, and it was
          in this role that I discovered how to combine my interest in human
          behavior while challenging myself in new ways technically. This
          culminated in leading a large-scale accessibility project that brought
          an entire assessment library into full WCAG compliance. That
          experience ignited my interest in pursuing a career in UX development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pursue this interest, I have been eagerly honing my skills in
          front-end languages, frameworks, and design principles. Recently, I
          obtained a certificate in Web Development from the UC-Berkeley
          extension program, and I am excited to continue growing as a developer
          while driving my passion for continuous learning.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">As a coworker</h2>
        <p>
          I value collaboration and communication. I enjoy serving as the
          connection point between technically-oriented and content-oriented
          people on the team. I value both perspectives to ensure that all needs
          are met and understood. I bring positivity, eagerness to learn new
          things, and strong attention to detail to every project I work on.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-tertiary">As a person</h2>
        <p>
          I asked DALL E 2 to create an AI-generated painting for me based on my
          favorite things: “vintage furniture, reading, a black lab (aka my dog,
          Oakley), house plants, nature, the Green Bay Packers, coffee, camping”
        </p>
        <p>It did not disappoint.</p>
        <p>
          If I had to add to that list, I would make sure it also included
          puzzles (both jigsaw and word puzzles – I'm currently trying to break
          my max-streak of 163 days on Wordle).
